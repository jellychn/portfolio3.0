                        <p>
                            Hey there! I'm Jerry, a seasoned <span className="highlight">software engineer</span> with a dynamic background spanning over 3 years in the tech industry. My journey in software engineering has been an incredible learning curve, allowing me to hone my skills in coding and problem-solving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond the lines of code, I've developed a deep passion for designâ€”its aesthetics, functionality, and the human experience it creates. This fascination has steered my interests toward the captivating world of <span className="highlight">UX/UI design</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Driven by a desire to bridge the gap between technology and user-centric design, I'm currently on a path to explore and immerse myself in the realm of UX/UI. I firmly believe that creating seamless, intuitive experiences is not just a profession but an art form that merges innovation with empathy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My background in software engineering provides me with a solid technical foundation, while my enthusiasm for design fuels my creativity and attention to detail. I'm excited to leverage this unique blend of skills as I embark on this new chapter, seeking opportunities to contribute my expertise and learn from the forefront of UX/UI design.
